This program converts a test file into a binary file and vice versa. The files contain information
of imaginary students in an university.

---Before Testing---
Before trying to test the program, make sure that you download the "makefile",
which has Unix commands to make it easier for you to test the program.


---Makefile commands---
The following command can be used to make it easier for you to test the program.
"make" - This will do everything you need to test the code. Preprocessing, Compilation, Assembly, and
Linking. It will produce an executable file called "converter". Make sure that you downloaded all the
files before running this command.

If you are interested to make some changes to the code and debug, you might find the following commands
usefull:
"make clean" - This will clean the current repository. It will delete the object files and the executable
file.
"make warning" - This will produce warnings and errors about the code.

---Testing the Program---
The following commands can be used to test the code. Make sure that you move the files from 'testCases'
to the repository you are working on.
"converter -t t1.txt b1" - This will convert t1.txt to a binary file called b1.
"converter -t t2.txt b2" - This will convert t2.txt to a binary file called b2.
"converter -b b1 test1.txt" - This will convert b1 to a text file called test1.txt.
"converter -b b2 test2.txt" - This will convert b2 to a text file called test2.txt.
"diff t1.txt test1.txt" - This will check that the original file (t1.txt) is the same as the new file
(test1.txt).
"diff t2.txt test2.txt" - This will check that the original file (t2.txt) is the same as the new file
(test2.txt).
"converter -s b1" - This will get information from the binary file b1 and display it.
"converter -s b2" - This will get information from the binary file b2 and display it.

---Have fun playing with the code.---
